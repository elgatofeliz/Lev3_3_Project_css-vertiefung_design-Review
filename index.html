            <p class="graphikMedium">We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the
                design works well and where
                it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
                design more efficient?”</p>

                <h4 class="graphikMedium">A picture is worth a thousand words</h4>
                <p class="theinhardtLt">Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be
                    improved but also make
                    revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                <h4 class="graphikMedium">Design Report</h4>
                <p class="theinhardtLt">We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a
                    detailed visual report
                    with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
                </p>
                <h4 class="graphikMedium">Ways to Redesign</h4>
                <p class="theinhardtLt">We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from
                    freelancers to
                    high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
                    and quick but effective improvements.
